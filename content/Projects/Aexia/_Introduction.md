I worked from July 2022 until February 2024 on [Aexia](https://store.steampowered.com/app/2480260/Aexia/) which is a platform for creating, sharing and play playing VR role-playing games. I worked originally as a programmer, but I worked also as a scrum master, product owner and later on 2023 I worked as a level designer.

As a level designer made three subprojects:

[[Beautiful Corners]]
[[Black Skull]]
[[Premade SETs and Maps List]]

Some challenges for creating maps inside Aexia that should be noticed:
- A map inside Aexia are a group of SETs, which are cubicles with 5x5x5 meters and when they are placed beside each other they combine by removing the walls between them.
- A person inside a SET can't see outside it, if the wall placed don't have any windows, but who is outside it, can see inside normally.
- To connect two groups of SETs, the GM could create a path for the players by connecting two portals.

This three rules create very interesting challenges to create outside and inside environments without using 3d models to block the vision for the players. All the SETs and maps created by me didn't had any token that could be used as a vision blocker for the players as walls or doors, except for the Medieval Citadel.
